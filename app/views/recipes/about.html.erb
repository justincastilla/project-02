        <h4 class="card-title">Melissa Carlson</h4>
        <p class="card-text lead">For this project, Melissa primarily worked on the recipe search algorithm and the interface to choose ingredients. She enjoys front-end and back-end work equally. </br>This project was extra exciting for her because she had never used Javascript within a Rails app before and her favorite thing about coding is learning how to make different technologies play nicely with one another. </p>

        <h4 class="card-title">Franklin Zuniga</h4>
        <p class="card-text lead">For Pantry Hero, Franklin was mostly focused on designing and styling the app as he enjoys working more in the front-end. However, he did also do some work in the database by helping to seed data, join tables and add columns to a table. </br></br> The most exciting part for Franklin was learning the new Bootstrap 4 components and applying it to our site features! </p>
