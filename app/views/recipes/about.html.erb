        <h4 class="card-title">Melissa Carlson</h4>
        <p class="card-text lead">For this project, Melissa primarily worked on the recipe search algorithm and the interface to choose ingredients. She enjoys front-end and back-end work equally. <br />This project was extra exciting for her because she had never used Javascript within a Rails app before and her favorite thing about coding is learning how to make different technologies play nicely with one another. </p>
